# resume template

Hi friends! Here's a happy resume template (populated with my info currently, but hey, what are forks for?) built with basic HTML + CSS.

### Exporting as a PDF

I previously used an API from PDF Crowd to build this using a Node.js script, but found that the even easier way is to opn the page in Safari, size the browser window to precisely fit the border of the page, and use `File > Export to PDF...` to save the PDF document to your local machine (including all working links, which is nice). This works better than Chrome or Firefox's `File > Print > Save to PDF`, which I found really messed up text colors and margins.
